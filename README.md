In this repository I share how to make the 13 arquimedean solids 
using the POV-Ray language. I also added a picture with each code 
so you can see the picture before download the code. 

Every code is independent and you do not need download anything 
but POV-Ray and the code and run it. 

If you want more information read my paper with other mates 
about how to build all of them and the theory behind it. 
The pdf is in this repository with name document-published.pdf
